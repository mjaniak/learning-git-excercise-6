            <p>Remem­ber those walls I built?
                Well, baby they’re tum­bling down
                And they didn’t even put up a fight
                They didn’t even make a sound
                I found a way to let you in
                But, I never really had a doubt
                Stan­ding in the light of your halo
                I got my angel now
